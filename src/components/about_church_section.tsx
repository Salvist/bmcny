            Bethany Miracle Center of New York (BMC NY) is an Indonesian
            Christian church with a heart for building faith and spreading the
            Gospel. Located in the vibrant city of New York, our church offers a
            family-oriented atmosphere where believers can grow together in
            Christ. We gather weekly for Sunday services conducted in
            Indonesian, with English translation available upon request,
            ensuring everyone feels welcomed and included. In addition to our
            main service, we provide a dedicated kids ministry to help young
            hearts grow in their faith. Whether you're new to the city, seeking
            spiritual growth, or looking for a Christ-centered community, BMC NY
            invites you to worship, connect, and walk in faith with us.
